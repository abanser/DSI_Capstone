# <center> Preliminary Proposal for Capstones </center>

## <center> Proposal 1 - Strava meets Zillow </center>

### Description
This project will research correlations between workout habits of residents of a given area and real estate value. My general intuition is that there exists a positive correlation between these features. I plan to quantify the workout habits of a region by aggregating Strava segment data. For real estate, I plan to use Zillow home value estimates and or home value projections.

### Question
Is there a correlation between population workout habits and real estate value? If so, how strong or how weak? Does this correlation vary between areas? Is there any other interesting information I can learn from overlaying these sets of data?

### Presentation
I will present my work with plots and presentations slides. If I have enough time I will attempt D3 visualization

### Data Sources
My data sources are Strava's API and Zillow's API. Both tools have adequate documentation for their APIs which I plan to take advantage of.

### Next Steps
Start gathering the data - I will start locally with Austin and complete a full cycle of analysis. If I have enough time, I will broaden the scope to other cities in Texas and other states.


## <center> Proposal 2 - YouTube - Why is Ryan's Toy Review so popular? </center>

### Description

Ryan's Toy Review is one of the most popular YouTube channels, with over 12 million subscribers and billions of views. It features Ryan, a 7 year old and his family, opening up toys and playing. Most of the videos are recorded with camera phones. On the surface, there is nothing special about these videos. However, Forbes reported that Ryan's channel made about $11 million dollars in revenue between June 1, 2016, and June 1, 2017.

I am curious to find out what makes channels go viral? My intuition is that popular YouTube channels have a viral video - the equivalent of a hit song, which introduce people to these channels and lead to their popularity.

### Question

Is there a common characteristic between popular channels?

### Presentation

I will present my work with plots and presentations slides. If I have enough time I will attempt D3 visualization

### Data Sources

My data sources are YouTube website crawling and YouTube API.

### Next Steps

I will start gathering data on videos from Ryan's Toy Reviews channel. I will then broaden my scope to other popular channels and see if I can generalize certain characteristics of these YouTube celebrities.

## <center> Proposal 3 - Do happy employees translate to successful companies? </center>

### Description

Is there an incentive for employers to treat their employees well? Do happy employees translate into success for the company? Using Glassdoor employer ratings, I can get a sense of how happy employees are at a company. With that information, I can research if there exists a correlation between employee happiness and company success? *I am still reasoning about a good measure of company success to use here. My first attempt is to use stock trends for publicly traded companies.*

### Question

Do happy employees lead to successfull companies?

### Presentation

I will present my work with plots and presentations slides. If I have enough time I will attempt D3 visualization

### Data Sources

My data sources are Glassdoor website crawling and stock market trends overtime.

### Next Steps

Get company ratings from Glassdoor. Restrict only to public companies.
